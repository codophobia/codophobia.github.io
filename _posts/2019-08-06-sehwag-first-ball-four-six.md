Virender Sehwag was a fearless batsman. He would start attacking the opposition right from ball one. This was the one thing that made Sehwag unique. If there was a ball to be hit, he would hit it. There was a time when he started his innings with a four in 6 consecutive matches. It also meant that India's scorecard read 4-0 after 0.1 overs. It included 5 instances during the 2011 world cup that India won. Sehwag had also his first ball for a six once in ODI. It was during the 2nd final of VB Series in 2004 and India was chasing a huge total of 359\. India went on to lose the match but his first ball six still remains in our memory.

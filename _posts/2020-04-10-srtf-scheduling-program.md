## What is SRTF Scheduling Algorithm

* SRTF stands for Shortest Remaining Time First.
* The process that has least burst time gets the CPU first.
* The processes gets serviced by the CPU in order of their burst time in ascending order.
* SRTF is preemptive. A process that is running on the CPU can be removed if a new process arrives in ready queue with lower burst time than current process.
* SRTF is basically preemtive version of SJF.

## Implementing SRTF Algorithm in C++

**Input**

1. Number of processes
2. Arrival time of each process. If all process arrives at the same time, this can be set to 0 for all processes.
3. Burst time of each process

**Output**

1. Start Time(ST), Completion Time(CT), Turnaround Time(TAT), Waiting Time(WT) and Response Time(RT) for each process.
2. Average turnaround Time, average waiting time and average response time.
3. Throughput and cpu utilization.

**Algorithm**

```c
completed = 0
current_time = 0
while(completed != n) {
    find process with minimum burst time among process that are in ready queue at current_time
    if(process found) {
        if(process is getting CPU for the first time) {
            start_time = current_time
        }
        burst_time = burst_time - 1
        current_time = current_time + 1
        if(burst_time == 0) {
            completion_time  = current_time
            turnaround_time = completion_time - arrival_time
            waiting_time = turnaround_time - burst_time
            response_time = start_time - arrival_time

            mark process as completed
            completed++
        }
    }
    else {
        current_time++
    }
}
```

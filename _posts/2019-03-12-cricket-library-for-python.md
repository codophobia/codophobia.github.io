Pycricbuzz is a python library which can be used to get live scores, commentary and full scorecard for recent and live matches.

### Installing pycricbuzz

```bash
pip install pycricbuzz or pip3 install pycricbuzz
```
Or you can directly download the package from github:<a href="https://github.com/codophobia/pycricbuzz" target="_blank">pycricbuzz github</a>

### Importing pycricbuzz in your script

```python
from pycricbuzz import Cricbuzz
```

### Create a cricbuzz object

```python
c = Cricbuzz()
```

We can use this object to work with all the functions provided by pycricbuzz.

### Fetch all the matches provided by cricbuzz

```python
from pycricbuzz import Cricbuzz
import json
c = Cricbuzz()
matches = c.matches()
print (json.dumps(matches,indent=4)) #for pretty prinitng
```

Output(Printing details of one of matches from list of matches):

```json

    {
        "id": "21653",
        "mchstate": "toss",
        "mnum": "5th ODI",

        "venue_location": "Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India",

    }
]
```

We get a list of matches with each match having its details. The 'id' attribute of a match is important as it will be used to fetch commentary and scorecard for that match.
There is also another way to get the information for a match using match id.

```python
def match_info(mid):
    c = Cricbuzz()
    minfo = c.matchinfo(mid)
    print(json.dumps(minfo, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

The output will be same as above. It's another way of getting match information when you have match_id with you.

### Fetching the live score of a match

```python
def live_score(mid):
    c = Cricbuzz()
    lscore = c.livescore(mid)
    print(json.dumps(lscore, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

Output:

```json
{
    "batting": {
        "batsman": [
            {
                "balls": "43",
                "fours": "0",
                "name": "Asghar Afghan",
                "runs": "8",
                "six": "0"
            },
            {
                "balls": "32",
                "fours": "1",
                "name": "Nabi",
                "runs": "19",
                "six": "0"
            }
        ],
        "score": [
            {
                "declare": null,
                "inning_num": "1",
                "overs": "25.2",
                "runs": "77",
                "wickets": "4"
            }
        ],
        "team": "Afghanistan"
    },
    "bowling": {
        "bowler": [
            {
                "maidens": "0",
                "name": "James Cameron",
                "overs": "4.2",
                "runs": "15",
                "wickets": "0"
            }
        ],
        "score": [],
        "team": "Ireland"
    }
}
```

It gives us the information about the match and details of the batting and bowling team. The batsman and bowlers are the current two batsman batting and current two bowlers bowling.

### Fetch commentary of the match

```python
def commentary(mid):
    c = Cricbuzz()
    comm = c.commentary(mid)
    print(json.dumps(comm, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

Output:

```json
{
    "commentary": [
        {
            "comm": "Simi Singh to Nabi, no run",
            "over": "26.2"
        },
        {
            "comm": "Simi Singh to Nabi, no run, tossed up outside off, Nabi gets an inside edge on the clip to short fine",
            "over": "26.1"
        },
        {
            "comm": "Asghar Afghan is still struggling from the shoulder injury he sustained in the last match. Winced in pain after that last six, but going on for his team",
            "over": null
        },
        {
            "comm": "James Cameron to Asghar Afghan, no run, tossed up on off, Afghan leans well forward and blocks",
            "over": "25.6"
        },
        {
            "comm": "James Cameron to Asghar Afghan, no run, flighted on the leg-stump line, clipped straight to the fielder at backward leg, wanted a single and is sent abck",
            "over": "25.5"
        },
        {
            "comm": "James Cameron to Asghar Afghan, <b>SIX</b>, that has been <b>thumped</b>, juicy full-toss from Cameron-Dow, Afghan moves across and slugs it high and over backward square leg for a maximum",
            "over": "25.4"
        },
        {
            "comm": "James Cameron to Asghar Afghan, <b>FOUR</b>, that's a poor ball from Cameron-Dow, dropped short and wide of off, Afghan made room and slapped it wide of cover - beats the fielder getting across from the deep",
            "over": "25.3"
        },
        {
            "comm": "James Cameron to Asghar Afghan, no run, dropped short and wide of off, cracked straight to Dockrell at cover",
            "over": "25.2"
        },
        {
            "comm": "James Cameron to Asghar Afghan, no run, turn for Cameron-Dow, but once again the length is short, allows Afghan to push it to the off-side",
            "over": "25.1"
        },
        {
            "comm": "Simi Singh to Nabi, no run, full and at the stumps, whipped straight to the fielder at mid-wicket",
            "over": "24.6"
        }
    ]
}
```

"Commentary" is a list containing all the commentary texts.

### Fetch scorecard of a match

```python
def scorecard(mid):
    c = Cricbuzz()
    scard = c.scorecard(mid)
    print(json.dumps(scard, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

```json

    "scorecard": [
        {

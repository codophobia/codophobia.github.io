## What is Producer-consumer Problem?
 
The producer and consumer share a fixed-size buffer used as a queue. The producer’s job is to generate data and put this in the buffer. The consumer’s job is to consume the data from this buffer, one at a time.
 
**Problem Statement**
 
How do you make sure that producer doesn’t try to put data in buffer when the buffer is full and consumer doesn’t try to consumer data when the buffer is empty?
 
When producer tries to put data into the buffer when it is full, it wastes cpu cycles. The same is true for consumer it tries to consumer from an empty buffer. It’s better that they go on sleep in these cases so that the scheduler can schedule another process.

## Pseudocode Solution using Semaphore and Mutex
 
**Initialization**
 
```c
Mutex mutex; // Used to provide mutual exclusion for critical section
Semaphore empty = N; // Number of empty slots in buffer
Semaphore full = 0 // Number of slots filled
int in = 0; //index at which producer will put the next data
int out = 0; // index from which the consumer will consume next data
int buffer[N];
```
 
**Producer Code**
 
```c
while(True) {
   // produce an item
   wait(empty); // wait/sleep when there are no empty slots
   wait(mutex);
   buffer[in] = item
   in = (in+1)%buffersize;
   signal(mutex);
   signal(full); // Signal/wake to consumer that buffer has some   data and they can consume now
}
```
 
**Consumer Code**
 
```c
while(True) {
   wait(full); // wait/sleep when there are no full slots
   wait(mutex);
   item = buffer[out];
   out = (out+1)%buffersize;
   signal(mutex);
   signal(empty); // Signal/wake the producer that buffer slots are emptied and they can produce more
   //consumer the item
}
```
 
## Solution in C using Semaphore and Mutex
 
We will be converting the above Pseudocode to actual code in C language. Let's first have a look at some important data structures we will be using in the code.
 
* One can use include <semaphore.h> header file and declare a semaphore of type sem_t in c.
* Some important methods that can be used with semaphore in c
   1. **sem_init** -> Initialise the semaphore to some initial value
   2. **sem_wait** -> Same as wait() operation
   3. **sem_post** -> Same as Signal() operation
   4. **sem_destroy** -> Destroy the semaphore to avoid memory leak
* One can use include <pthread.h> header file and declare a mutex of type pthread_mutex_t in c.
* Some important methods that can be used with semaphore in c
   1. **pthread_mutex_init** -> Initialise the mutex
   2. **pthread_mutex_lock()** -> Same as wait() operation
   3. **pthread_mutex_unlock()** -> Same as Signal() operation
   4. **pthread_mutex_destroy()** -> Destroy the mutex to avoid memory leak

![2011 world cup winning moment]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dhoni.jpeg)

If you love Dhoni or hate Dhoni, you will always cherish the above moment - Dhoni finishing the 2011 WC final with a six. Dhoni has finished a lot of matches with a six before this one but this one was special.
When I watch this moment again and again today, I get goosbumps all over my body. 

When Dhoni arrived at the International stage, he used to be very agressive. His agressive batting won India a lot of matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka during his initial stages.
As the time passed by and he got additional responsibility of captaincy, his batting approach chnaged. He started taking calculated risks and tried to take the match till last overs.
Sometimes the approach worked and sometimes it didn't. But we saw very less of finishing sixes. We still do see the "Dhoni of past" in IPL.

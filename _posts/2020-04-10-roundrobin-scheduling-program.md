## What is Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm

* Round robin scheduling algorithm is a kind of preemptive FCFS.
* A time quantum is associated with the algorithm. Each process gets CPU for some units of time which is decided by time quantum value and then again enter ready queue if they have burst time remaining.
* The processing is done in FIFO order.

If you want to understand more about round robin algorithm with example, watch the below video.

## Implementing SRTF Algorithm in C++

**Input**

1. Number of processes
2. Arrival time of each process. If all process arrives at the same time, this can be set to 0 for all processes.
3. Burst time of each process
4. Time quantum

**Output**

1. Start Time(ST), Completion Time(CT), Turnaround Time(TAT), Waiting Time(WT) and Response Time(RT) for each process.
2. Average turnaround Time, average waiting time and average response time.
3. Throughput and cpu utilization.

**Algorithm**

1. Stable sort the processes in order of arrival time in ascending order.
2. We will be using a FIFO queue to implement this algorithm
3. We will first push the first process from the sorted list into queue.
4. We will use a array to check if the process is in the queue or not.
5. Keep track of the time using a variable - current_time
6. If the process is getting CPU for the first time, record its start time as current_time.
7. Give quantum unit of time to the process that is at front in the queue and pop this process from the queue.
8. If the burst time of this process becomes 0, calculate CT, TAT, WT and RT for it.
9. If some process has arrived when this process was executing, insert them into the queue.
10. If the current process has burst time remianing, push the process into queue again.
11. If the queue is empty, pick the first process from the list that is not completed.
12. Keep doing this till all processes are completed.


```
TAT = CT - AT
WT = TAT - BT
RT = ST - AT
```

If you want to understand how these formulas are derived, watch the below video.

Very few batsman have finished a cricket match with a six in test cricket. If one looks at the data from 2005, only 13 batsman have acheived this feat.
Batting in the 4th innings is a tough task and the probability of winning a test match by chasing is less.

In ODI cricket, Dhoni holds the record for finishing match with a six maximum times - [dhoni finishing in odi with a six](https://shivammitra.com/cricket/dhoni-finishing-with-six/)

In Test cricket, this record is held by Misbah-ul-Haq who has done it 4 times. No other batsman has done it more than once from 2005.

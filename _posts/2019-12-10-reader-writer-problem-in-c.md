## What is readers writers problem?

Suppose that a database is to be shared among several concurrent processes.
Some of these processes may want only to read the database, whereas others
may want to update (that is, to read and write) the database. We distinguish
between these two types of processes by referring to the former as readers
and to the latter as writers. Obviously, if two readers access the shared data
simultaneously, no adverse effects will result. However, if a writer and some
other process (either a reader or a writer) access the database simultaneously,
chaos may ensue.

To ensure that these difficulties do not arise, we require that the writers
have exclusive access to the shared database while writing to the database. This
synchronization problem is referred to as the readers-writers problem. 

The readers-writers problem has several variations, all involving
priorities. The simplest one, referred to as the first readers-writers problem,
requires that no reader be kept waiting unless a writer has already obtained
permission to use the shared object. In other words, no reader should wait for
other readers to finish simply because a writer is waiting.

## Pseudocode Solution using Semaphore and Mutex

**Initialization**

```c
Semaphore wrt = 1; // A binary semaphore that will be used both for mutual exclusion and signalling
Mutex mutex; // Provides mutual exclusion when readcount is being modified
int readcount = 0; // To keep count of the total readers
```

**Writer**

```c
wait(wrt);
// Perform write operation
signal(wrt);
```

**READER**

```c
wait(mutex);
readcount++;
if(readcount == 1) {
    wait(wrt);
}
signal(mutex);
// Perform read operation

wait(mutex);
readcount--;
if(readcount == 0) {
    signal(wrt);
}
signal(mutex);
```

* Writer can only write when the readcount is zero or there are no readers waiting.
* If the first reader executes wait(wrt) operation before the writer does, then writer gets blocked.
* Only when the last reader exits, it calls the signal(wrt) operation signalling writer to continue
* Similarly, when a writer starts writing(readcount=0) then the first reader gets blocked on wait(wrt) and this blocks all the readers.

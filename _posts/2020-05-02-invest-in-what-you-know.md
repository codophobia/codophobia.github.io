## Invest In What You Know Approach
 
Peter Lynch coined the famous investing ideology – “Invest in what you know”. As the manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments between 1977 and 1990, Lynch averaged a 29.2% annual return, consistently more than doubling the S&P 500 stock market index and making it the best-performing mutual fund in the world.
During his 13 year tenure, assets under management increased from $18 million to $14 billion. When he ran Magellan, he says, one of every 100 Americans was invested in it
 
Lynch got a lot of ten bagger ideas from buying stocks whose products he and his wife and children used frequently and liked them.
How Peter Lynch's wife Carolyn helped him spot a six bagger stock.
 
> L’eggs is the perfect example of the power of common knowledge. In the early part of that decade, before I took over Fidelity Magellan, I was working as a securities analyst at the firm. I didn’t find L’eggs in my research, my wife found it by going to the grocery store. It was easy enough to find out that L’eggs was made by Hanes and that Hanes was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Once Carolyn alerted me to Hanes, I did the customary research into the story. The story was even better than I’d thought, so with the same confidence as the fireman who bought Tambrands, I recommended the stock to Fidelity’s portfolio managers. Hanes turned out to be a six bagger before it was taken over by Consolidated Foods, now Sara Lee.
 
I will try to apply Peter Lynch's approach to investing to Indian Stock Market. I will try to list down the companies whose products we use in our day to day life and are listed in the stock market.
Do keep in mind that liking a product from a company should not be the only reason to invest. You should also look at the company financials before deciding to invest in it.
